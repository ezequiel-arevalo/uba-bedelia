## ðŸŽ¯ Key Components

### StudentManagement (`components/student-management.tsx`)
Main component that orchestrates the entire system:
- Manages all state (students, filters, pagination, modals)
- Handles search and filtering logic
- Calculates dynamic statistics
- Renders the complete interface

### StudentModal (`components/student-modal.tsx`)
Reusable modal for create/edit operations:
- Form validation and error handling
- Dynamic mode switching (create vs edit)
- Diplomatura dropdown with predefined options

### DeleteConfirmModal (`components/delete-confirm-modal.tsx`)
Confirmation dialog for safe deletion:
- Prevents accidental deletions
- Shows student details for confirmation
- Clean cancel/confirm actions

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### State Management
- **React useState**: Local state for all data and UI states
- **Derived State**: Filtered and paginated data computed from base state
- **Real-time Updates**: Statistics and counts update automatically

### Filtering Logic
\`\`\`typescript
// Multi-layered filtering system
const filteredStudents = students
  .filter(student => searchTerm match)
  .filter(student => diplomatura filter match)
  .filter(student => approval status match)
  .sort(by selected column and direction)
\`\`\`

### Pagination System
- **Items per page**: Fixed at 10 students
- **Dynamic page calculation**: Based on filtered results
- **Auto-reset**: Returns to page 1 when filters change
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons + numbered pages

### Statistics Calculation
Dynamic stats based on currently filtered students:
- **Total Students**: Count of filtered results
- **Approved**: Count of approved students in current view
- **Not Approved**: Count of non-approved students in current view
- **Average Attendance**: Mean attendance of visible students

## ðŸŽ¨ Design System

### Color Palette
